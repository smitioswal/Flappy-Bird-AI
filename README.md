Learning to play the famous Flappy Bird by using NEAT Python. This code uses search and optimise technique called genetic 
algorithm which creates a particular number of random configurations, the best configuration of them is used 
to create the next generation of neural networks, as we repeat the process, with time, we observe that the 
performance gets better.
